    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the last weeks I reimplemented the error handling of the HRS app in a way that is painless and very fast for the developer to use, and gives the user a good, detailed and specific error while even allowing him to recover from certain error cases. The way I did this was basically by reimplementing a concept that is available on OS X for a long time now.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<p>I have created a library that is open sourced and maintained by my company and me. It implements the workflow described below. You can use it under the Apache 2.0 License and it is available on <a href="https://github.com/Hotel-Reservation-Service/HRSCustomErrorHandling">github as HRSCustomErrorHandling</a> and via <a href="http://cocoapods.org/?q=HRSCustomErrorHandling">cocoapods</a>. If you do so, I would be happy if you&rsquo;d let me know.</p>

<h2>Common error handling</h2>

<p>Error handling on iOS has always been very painful. In general you trigger an action on the users behalf in one of your view controllers and you might get an <code>NSError</code> in return. There are two common approaches to deal with this error:</p>

<ol>
<li>Display a generic error message to the user that says &lsquo;Something went wrong. Please try again later.&rsquo;</li>
<li>Have a huge block of code that checks the error domain and the error code every time an error can be returned and provide a custom error message to the most common error cases.</li>
</ol>


<p>The latter is definitely the better one as it gives the user a better feedback than &lsquo;something went wrong&rsquo;. However, it is a much bigger pain for the developer, so it is also the option that is rarely used.</p>

<h2>What is already out there?</h2>

<p>The approach I took was to first look up existing concepts. There is an error handling that is already available in iOS&rsquo;s big brother, OS X, that reduces the code to display a custom error message to the user to a single line and also gives the user an option to recover from certain errors.</p>

<p>There already is a sample implementation of this error handling from the people over at <a href="http://realmacsoftware.com/blog/cocoa-error-handling-and-recovery">RealMac software</a>. However a couple of features are missing in their sample that I find very useful in the OS X version.</p>

<p>We wanted to have a way to handle specific errors in a custom and asynchronous way but at a central place in the app. Imagine a server connection that returns an error to you and tells you, that the user is not logged in to the server. You don&rsquo;t want to simply tell the user that this is the case and you also don&rsquo;t want to handle this with a specific dialog in every single part of your app that might be able to get this error. Instead there should be a single place in the application that checks for this error and displays your login dialog.</p>

<p>The error handling I am going to describe in this blog post can deal with this and a couple of other scenarios.</p>

<h2>Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s first check which component of the app is responsible for what. Again, OS X is a good guideline for this.</p>

<h3>Creation</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine there is a method that creates an <code>NSError</code> instance and passes it to the caller. A method like <code>- (BOOL)save:(NSError **)error</code>. This method usually is somewhere in your data abstraction layer or in other frameworks. If this method is in your code, this is the place where you have as much context information available as possible. You know exactly why the error happened and what went wrong. You might even know what to do to make the error go away. This is the part of code that should put all these informations into the <code>NSError</code> when creating it.</p>

<h3>Handling</h3>

<p>The caller of the <code>save:</code> method mentioned above is your view controller in most of the cases. It is the one that knows what lead to the save action and &ndash; if there are any parameters to the method it called &ndash; it also knows what parameters have been used and what to do if this action should be executed a second time. This layer does not need to have any information about what went wrong. The only information it is interested in is &lsquo;should I try this again or not?&rsquo;.</p>

<p>There are a couple of rare cases where your view controller might also want to modify or skip error presentation. For example a login view controller might not want to display the general &lsquo;your credentials are invalid&rsquo; error, instead it might want to show an inline error message close to the login screen&rsquo;s input text fields to show the user that something went wrong. So there needs to be a way to customize error handling in view controllers.</p>

<h3>Displaying</h3>

<p>Displaying an error is a task that should be handled in general in an applcation. You do not want every error dialog to look different. You might want to show all your errors in a simple alert view or in a custom overlay that integrates nicely into your app&rsquo;s ui, but they should all look the same.</p>

<h2>NSError</h2>

<p>How to create an <code>NSError</code> that has all the information mentioned above? The good thing is, <code>NSError</code> already has an interface to provide all this, and it is right in front of you: Have a look at the keys you can put into the <code>userInfo</code> dictionary of an <code>NSError</code>. There are a couple that are quite common when creating custom errors. The one that is used the most is probably <code>NSLocalizedDescriptionKey</code>. We are not going to use that &ndash; bummer.</p>

<p>Instead, we are going to use almost all of the others:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey</code><br/>
This describes what went wrong. This is going to be presented in the title of an alert view, later on.</p></li>
<li><p><code>NSLocalizedRecoverySuggestionErrorKey</code><br/>
This describes what the user can do to fix the error. For example you can tell the user something like <em>&lsquo;Try turning it off and on again&rsquo;</em>, but also some more useful information like <em>&lsquo;Do you want to overwrite the existing file with your new one? This will delete the existing file permanently.&rsquo;</em></p></li>
<li><p><code>NSLocalizedRecoveryOptionsErrorKey</code><br/>
This key should contain an <code>NSArray</code> with localized strings that describe the actions the user can take. Each element is used later on as the text of a button. You should make sure that this key contains at least one cancel operation that simply does nothing except dismissing the alert. A possible array could look like this: <code>@[ @"Overwrite", @"Cancel" ]</code><br/>
One important fact about this array is, that the first option in the array is the default option. This means that if you are going to present the error in an alert view, it is the option on the right most button that is displayed in bold text. In this case that would be the <em>&lsquo;Overwrite&rsquo;</em> option, but be carefull when making a destructive operation the default one!</p></li>
<li><p><code>NSRecoveryAttempterErrorKey</code><br/>
Now this is the most interesting key. It contains an object that conforms to <code>NSErrorRecoveryAttempting</code> protocol. This protocol basically contains a method that can be called with the index of the option the user has choosen. The recovery attempter should then try to fullfil the action behind this option and report back whether it was able to recover from the error or not. If the recovery attempter was successful in recoverying from the error, it is safe for the presenter to retry the action that lead to the error.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>With the above keys we are able to carry all information that is necessary to handle an error case properly inside the <code>NSError</code> object that describes the error. Besides the information shown to the user we can also add logic to the error that can try to recover from an error and communicate back whether we can safely retry the action or not.</p>

<h2>Responder chain</h2>

<p>OS X is using the responder chain for handling and displaying the error. The responder chain is something that is rarely used in iOS by applications, yet it is used by the frameworks all the time. It is responsible for delivering actions like text input or motion gestures.</p>

<p>It is very useful for transporting information up to the application from every <code>UIResponder</code> object through out the app. The good think is: A lot of the objects you are dealing with on a daily basis are in fact inheriting from <code>UIResponder</code>. The one that is well known for being a responder is probably <code>UIView</code>. But all your <code>UIViewController</code>s are responder objects, as well. Even your <code>UIApplication</code> is a responder object, and in the case you are making a game, <code>SKNode</code> is one, too. This basically means that all your code that deals with presentation is a responder or has very easy access to a responder.</p>

<p>Another great feature about responders is, that they build a chain. Each responder object implements a method called <code>nextResponder</code> that returns the next responder in the chain. The chain is build from the deepest point in your application up to the application itself and also, since a couple of iOS releases, even up to your app delegate, as long as it inherits from <code>UIResponder</code>. This means you can dispatch a message to <code>nextResponder</code> recursively and it will end up in your app delegate eventually, which is a very great place to handle application wide behaviour such as presenting an error. And because of this, that is exactly what we are going to do.</p>

<h3>Handling</h3>

<p>OS X implements a method on <code>NSResponder</code> that is called <code>-presentError:</code> which returns a bool telling you whether error recovery was successful or not. Due to the fact that showing modal dialogs on OS X are a blocking operation, this method is blocking, too. Obviously, if you would do this in an iOS application your UI would not be responding anymore and your app would be killed by the watch dog very fast. Luckily we do have blocks now, so this method could easily be changed to something like <code>-presentError:completionHandler:</code>.</p>

<p>The completion handler should then tell you whether error recovery was successful or not. If it was, you can simply call the method that lead to the error again. As blocks hold on to their context, this can be done very easily in most scenarios.</p>

<p>You need to implement the present error method yourself, as it is not available on iOS, but it is very simple. You could either use the github project I created or do this yourself. All the method does, is calling <code>-presentError:completionHandler:</code> on the object returned by <code>-nextResponder</code>. Well, not all. There are a couple of exceptions. Before it does forward the message up the responder chain it calls <code>willPresentError:</code> on itself.</p>

<h4><code>-willPresentError:</code></h4>

<p>This method gets the error passed in and returns an error. The base implementation of this method simply returns the error it was passed. You can now override this method to change the error you return or even return <code>nil</code>. If you return <code>nil</code>, the error is not forwarded up the responder chain by <code>presentError:completionHandler:</code>.</p>

<p>You can use this to solve the problem mentioned in the introduction. Your login view controller simply overrides <code>willPresentError:</code>, checks if the error passed in is a login error, and returns <code>nil</code> in this case. With this hook, every responder in the chain is capable of modifying the error or even stopping the error presentation.</p>

<h4><code>UIViewController</code></h4>

<p>Another exception in <code>-presentError:completionHandler:</code> is that it forwards the message to <code>-[UIApplication sharedApplication]</code> if calling <code>nextResponder</code> returns <code>nil</code>. This is because a <code>UIViewController</code> that is currently not participating in the view controller hierarchy will return <code>nil</code> when asked for its <code>nextResponder</code>.</p>

<h4>App Delegate</h4>

<p>There is one thing I simply dropped up to now: The errors you get from a framework you are using do not contain the informations you need for the custom error presentation. To upgrade these errors to enriched ones, you can once again override <code>-willPresentError:</code>, but this time do it in your app delegate. Now you have a place where you can add nice error messages to your most common framework errors. You should also add a fallback error message that probably simply tells the user that <em>&lsquo;something went wrong&rsquo;</em>. That is not a very good error message, but it is for sure better than showing the user a <em>&lsquo;The operation couldn’t be completed. (Cocoa error 1570.)&rsquo;</em>.</p>

<h2>Presenting</h2>

<p>Now that we ensured that your error will get passed to your app delegate, all you have to do is to override <code>-presentError:completionHandler:</code> in your app delegate and configure a <code>UIAlertView</code> or any other custom view that can show the error to the user. In this single place you can easily customize your error UI to fit perfectly into your app design. No more ugly default alert views in your nicely crafted user interface!</p>

<h2>HRSCustomErrorHandling</h2>

<p>I have open sourced the little library that is driving the error handling in the HRS iOS app I am working on during the day. It has a couple of nice little features that make your error creation even easier. For example you can simply create a recovery attempter with recovery blocks that are executed once the user taps on an option in the alert view. It is available under the Apache 2.0 License on <a href="https://github.com/Hotel-Reservation-Service/HRSCustomErrorHandling">github as HRSCustomErrorHandling</a> and via <a href="http://cocoapods.org/?q=HRSCustomErrorHandling">cocoapods</a>. If you use it, I would be happy if you&rsquo;d let me know.</p>

<p>I also gave a talk about custom error handling. The slides are available in the <a href="http://ios-coding.com/talks/">talks</a> section.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first post in a series of posts about <code>UIViewController</code> subclassing best practices I got used to. This series is about how to write a robust view controller that is as dynamic as possible and can be easily adopted to new technices you might use in your app in the future for whatever reason. E.g. you might have handled you view controller instantiation in code in the past but then decided to do it with storyboards; or you might change your underlying connection handling; or you might change from an <code>NSObject</code> based model structure to Core Data. These are all cases that will end up in a big refactoring of your view controllers if you don&rsquo;t be careful when implementing them. I did all these things with view controllers that where build with the best practices I am going to describe in this series, and most of the time I didn&rsquo;t even had to change a single line of code in my view controllers.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>In my experience, developers tend to be sloppy when implementing view controllers from time to time. It seems like many people are thinking about view controllers as the passive part that only needs to forward certain events to various layers in your app. The truth is, view controllers are actually one of the most active parts in your app. They need to decide what to do in certain situations and always need to have a proper overview of the state of the application. Therefore it is very important to have a clean structure in your controllers. Once I got used to this structure, I even got faster in implementing my view controllers.</p>

<p>In today&rsquo;s post I want to talk about proper model handling and how to keep your view controllers clean and reusable, even if you decide to refactor one of the more fundamental parts of your app, like the initialization of your view controllers.</p>

<h2>Controller initialization</h2>

<p>tldr; Do not write custom init methods.</p>

<p>It is as simple as that! There are lots of reasons why not to do this. The most obvious reason is, you loose the option to initialize your view controllers from a xib or a storyboard. Even though this is nothing you might consider at the moment, this is something that could change completely in the future. Apple is very good in making up new things you end up not knowing how you could have ever lived without them. If there will be a new feature you want to use, and it is implemented in Interface Builder, you have to use <code>initWithCoder:</code>. So make sure, your view controllers work with all designated initializers!</p>

<p>Most custom initialization methods I came across are used to hand over the model that should be displayed to the view controller. Sometimes you might want to pass a couple of parameters to the controller. In general, these models or parameters end up in a property at some point. Expose these properties or add a configuration method to your view controllers. Your view controller does not need a model to exist; really! It might need a model from a product point of view, but not from a technical. All the labels, buttons, text fields and other controls you have in your controller can render without the model. A label might be empty, a text field might not change a text inside your model, but your view controller does not crash. Put an assert inside <code>viewDidLoad</code> if you are afraid you might end up with a broken view controller, but in general: Handle these kind of guards in your data flow. Do not enforce things technically that are not technically necessary!</p>

<h2>View initialization</h2>

<p>tldr; Do not override <code>loadView</code>; create an update method for your models and call it in <code>viewDidLoad</code>.</p>

<p>You are loosing the option to initialize your views from a xib file. Interface Builder is the best WYSIWYG UI editor I have worked with, so far. And it is getting better every year. I am pretty confident, that you will end up using it one day, even if you don&rsquo;t at the moment.</p>

<p>In my eyes, the only reason to override <code>loadView</code> is to have a custom view controller whoes view property is something else than <code>UIView</code> or <code>UITableView</code>. You could write a <code>MyScrollViewController</code> class, whoes main view is a <code>UIScrollView</code>. Of course you could also add a scroll view as a subview to the main view in <code>viewDidLoad</code>, but if you want to implement your view controller in analogy to <code>UITableViewController</code> this is a valid argument to me, but be aware of the ramifications.</p>

<p>The more common case is, that you only want to setup the subviews. Setting your UI state to match your model can be done in <code>viewDidLoad</code> without any negative impact vs. doing it in <code>loadView</code>. In fact you should split up your view creation code from your view configuration code. Build your view hierarchy in <code>viewDidLoad</code> if you are not using interface builder. This will make sure that every time the main view is instanciated, the view hierarchy is set up accordingly.</p>

<p>Add a method <code>updateViewWithCurrentModel</code>, put your configuration code in there and call this method from <code>viewDidLoad</code> after setting up the view hierarchy. With this approach you have a stateless method that always configures your view according to your current model, regardless of when you call it. We will make use of this benefit in the next step.</p>

<p>Do not setup your view hierarchy in <code>viewWillAppear:</code>! I have seen this a couple of times; in the best case you will create new views even though this is not needed. In the worst case you will end up with a view hierarchy where every subview exists multiple times because you did not remove the old views properly.</p>

<h2>Custom setter</h2>

<p>tldr; implement a custom setter for your model and call your update method in it.</p>

<p>You can do the next step either by implementing KVO or through a custom setter. I tend to use a custom setter for mainly two reasons. First, there is not very much you can do wrong in a setter since the existence of ARC and second, I don&rsquo;t like the fact that it is not save to call super in <code>observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context:</code> as you need an inside of your superclass that &ndash; in my opinion &ndash; is non of your bussiness. However if you like KVO better, do it with KVO.</p>

<p>Implement the setter of the property you exposed in the first step yourself (or watch it with KVO). Write your own <code>setMyModel:</code> method, update the ivar and call your <code>updateViewWithCurrentModel</code> method in there if your view is loaded. If your view is not loaded, only set your ivar. As you are calling the <code>updateViewWithCurrentModel</code> in <code>viewDidLoad</code> as well, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about this when your view is not loaded. Your setter should look like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">setMyModel:</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">MyModel</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">myModel</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">_myModel</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">myModel</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">isViewLoaded</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">self</span> <span class="n">updateViewWithCurrentModel</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In case you are in a <code>UITableViewController</code> you propably don&rsquo;t need an update method. Simply call <code>reloadData</code> on your table view instead, but still make sure, the main view is loaded!</p>

<p>It is important to check whether your view is loaded or not. As the setter can be called by anyone at any time, a call to <code>self.view</code> could cause the view to load even though it is not displayed, which is a memory overhead that is completely useless. A view controller should only load its view when told so by its parent view controller. You should always check if a view is loaded in every method that is exposed in your public controller api before calling <code>self.view</code> or any method that does this internally.</p>

<h2>Asynchronous loading</h2>

<p>With the above view controller design you will get another benefit: If you are loading data asynchronously, you do not need a complex state machine anymore. All you need to do is set your model after the loading is done and your view controller will do the rest. I would recommend loading the data in the previous view controller anyway, but that is a topic I will handle in the next post about <code>UIViewController</code> subclassing.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>I uploaded a basic template for a new view controller as <a href="https://gist.github.com/michaelochs/a034f7dfddf1e6f3e1fa">MyViewController.h/m</a> to gist. You could easily create an Xcode template from this or generate custom Xcode snippets if you like.</p>

    <id>http://ios-coding.com/blog/2013/11/23/an-improved-way-to-integrate-reveal-into-your-xcode-project</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oliver Jones had a great article at the Itty Bitty Apps Blog about how to &lsquo;<a href="http://blog.ittybittyapps.com/blog/2013/11/07/integrating-reveal-without-modifying-your-xcode-project">Integrating Reveal without modifying your Xcode project</a>&rsquo; that was also featured in <a href="http://iosdevweekly.com/issues/120" title="iOS Dev Weekly Issue #120">iOS dev weekly</a>. Reveal is a great tool to debug layout issues. I highly encourage everybody to <a href="http://revealapp.com" title="Reveal website">check it out</a>. It improves debugging UI related issues like <code>UIView</code> position and clipping or <code>CALayer</code> ordering and really makes your life easier. Oliver&rsquo;s blog post explained a great way to integrate Reveal into your Xcode project without linking it automatically and without having it automatically starting up during app start. There are a couple of benefits with this approach.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>As the library is not linked automatically it is not discovered by Apple&rsquo;s static analyzer. This is great in the case that you forget to remove it before submitting to the App Store. I don&rsquo;t know if the Reveal library contains private APIs, but as it is a library that is meant to be used during development, I would consider this a possibility, if not at the moment maybe in the future.</p>

<p>The other benefit is that, as the Reveal service is not automatically run at app launch, you can debug your app without interference of the library and only fire up the library when you really need it. In the case you forget to remove it before the App Store build, people that get your app through the App Store still are not able to analyze your view hierarchy with Reveal.</p>

<p>A third great improvement is very useful for all the people that are working in a big office with dozens of other developers. If you have the Reveal library enabled in every build everybody makes, it becomes quite a challenge to select the right device in Reveal. You only want the Reveal service up and running when you really want to debug something.</p>

<p>Oliver used the LLDB init file <code>~/.lldbinit</code> to add a couple of aliases to load and start the Reveal library from the debugger:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>reveal_load_sim</code> &ndash; loads the Reveal library in the iOS simulator</li>
<li><code>reveal_load_dev</code> &ndash; loads the Reveal library on the device</li>
<li><code>reveal_start</code> &ndash; starts the Reveal library</li>
<li><code>reveal_stop</code> &ndash; stops the Reveal library</li>
</ul>


<p>However there are a couple of issues with the described approach that bothered me and that don&rsquo;t work very well with the workflow we have in the company I work at:</p>

<p>You still need to add the library to the copy step of your project file. Chances are high that you forget to remove this before running the App Store build. Even though the library is neither linked nor started automatically you don&rsquo;t want a library that you don&rsquo;t need and that increases your app by almost 4MB in your App Store ipa. This might make the difference between being downloadable through WiFi only or not. Besides that, it looks unprofessional in the case someone discovers this and it might open some security threads you don&rsquo;t think of.</p>

<p>When adding the library to your copy step you have two options: Use the library that is located in the <code>Reveal.app</code> folder or copy it to your project. In the first case you break the build process for everybody that doesn&rsquo;t have Reveal installed as the file will not be in the place where Xcode is looking for it. With the second approach you will run in to problems when different engineers have different versions of Reveal on their machines. it is pretty likely anyway that you will forget to update the library in the first place and only notice this when you really need it. Updating the library requires you to stop the running application and rebuild it after you updated the library. This reduces the benefit of the automatic approach dramatically.</p>

<p>Last but not least I don&rsquo;t want to have two load commands, <code>reveal_load_sim</code> and <code>reveal_load_dev</code>. This is more complicated than it should be. The debugger should be able to figure that out by itself or at best use the exact same approach on the device and simulator.</p>

<h2>reveal_load</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try to fix that little inconvenience first. With Oliver&rsquo;s approach we use the following aliases:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>~/.lldbinit </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>command alias reveal_load_sim expr (void*)dlopen("/Applications/Reveal.app/Contents/SharedSupport/iOS-Libraries/libReveal.dylib", 0x2);
</span><span class='line'>command alias reveal_load_dev expr (void*)dlopen([(NSString*)[(NSBundle*)[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"libReveal" ofType:@"dylib"] cStringUsingEncoding:0x4], 0x2);</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first alias is <code>reveal_load_sim</code>. It loads the Reveal library from the <code>Reveal.app</code> folder. This is a path that you obviously can only reach in the simulator. The second alias, <code>reveal_load_dev</code>, loads the <code>libReveal.dylib</code> from the application bundle. This only works when you add the library to your copy step before.</p>

<p>When you need to copy and update the library manually within your project it is quite helpful to be able to use Reveal in the simulator without copying the library first. As we try to improve this behavior in the next step anyway, let&rsquo;s simply remove the <code>reveal_load_sim</code> macro and rename <code>reveal_load_dev</code> to <code>reveal_load</code>. Our complete list of Reveal aliases in the <code>~/.lldbinit</code> now looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>~/.lldbinit </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>command alias reveal_load expr (void*)dlopen([(NSString*)[(NSBundle*)[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"libReveal" ofType:@"dylib"] cStringUsingEncoding:0x4], 0x2);
</span><span class='line'>command alias reveal_start expr (void)[(NSNotificationCenter*)[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:@"IBARevealRequestStart" object:nil];
</span><span class='line'>command alias reveal_stop expr (void)[(NSNotificationCenter*)[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:@"IBARevealRequestStop" object:nil];</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Using a script instead of the copy phase</h2>

<p>Now that we optimized the load command let&rsquo;s make sure that we always have the library version that our currently installed version of Reveal needs and that Reveal is not included if it is not available on the machine that is performing the build. Instead of adding the framework to the copy step we simply use a &lsquo;run script&rsquo; phase in our build progress to copy the framework into the .app folder. This script can check for the configuration you are currently building and wether the framework exists in the <code>Reveal.app</code> folder.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">APPBUNDLEPATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;${TARGET_BUILD_DIR}/${EXECUTABLE_NAME}.app/&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">REVEALFRAMEWORKPATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/Applications/Reveal.app/Contents/SharedSupport/iOS-Libraries/libReveal.dylib&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> -f <span class="s2">&quot;${REVEALFRAMEWORKPATH}&quot;</span> <span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="o">[</span> <span class="s2">&quot;${CONFIGURATION}&quot;</span> !<span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ReleaseAppStore&quot;</span> <span class="o">]</span>; <span class="k">then</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k"> </span>cp <span class="s2">&quot;${REVEALFRAMEWORKPATH}&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;${APPBUNDLEPATH}&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">fi</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first line defines the path to the .app folder of the application we are building. The second line defines the location of the <code>libReveal.dylib</code> file if you have a standard Reveal installation. Now we only have to perform two checks:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Does the libReveal.dylib file exist?</em> This is the first part of the condition and makes sure the build is successful on machines that do not have Reveal installed or where Reveal is installed in a different location.</li>
<li><em>Is the configuration we are currently building NOT <code>ReleaseAppStore</code>?</em> This is the configuration we are using for App Store distribution. You might need to change this to meet your environment. Maybe you are simply using the default <code>Release</code> build for App Store distribution or maybe you have another configuration name. Simply replace <code>ReleaseAppStore</code> to whatever configuration you are using. This ensures that the library is only copied when you are not building for the App Store.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you save this file somewhere in your project path, all you have to do is add a &lsquo;run script&rsquo; phase to your project and call this project by inserting the following line in the phase:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>bash <span class="s2">&quot;MyProject/Supporting Files/lazy-copy-reveal.sh&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Adjust this path to meet your environment and you are ready to go.</p>

<p>With this script and the above LLDB aliases everybody that has Reveal installed can simply pause the application at any time in the debugger and simply type <code>reveal_load</code> followed by <code>reveal_start</code>. After that, don&rsquo;t forget to resume your application. You can now immediately attach Reveal to your device. The library that is used in your project will automatically stay up to date with your Reveal version and you don&rsquo;t have to change anything in your project before submitting to the App Store.</p>

<p>I am only using this approach for a couple of days now and it has already been very useful as you can fire up Reveal anytime you have a UI issue without the need of restarting the application and reproducing the bug first.</p>

<p>I uploaded the two files you need to gist in the case you want to simply copy them:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>.lldbinit</code>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/michaelochs/7614557" title=".lldbinit on gist">https://gist.github.com/michaelochs/7614557</a></li>
<li><code>lazy-copy-reveal.sh</code>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/michaelochs/7614574" title="lazy-copy-reveal.sh on gist">https://gist.github.com/michaelochs/7614574</a></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A glossy looking button is a well known and widely used type of button that everybody knows if he or she hasn&rsquo;t been on the moon the last couple of years. Apple uses these buttons excessive. In OS X as well as on iOS. Those buttons look nice and they work very well when trying to achieve a polished, three dimensional look. However, they are always used with a background color that differs from the surrounding background or the surrounding background doesn&rsquo;t have much detail. This is because if you use this button on a background that has a lot of detail, like a photo, they don&rsquo;t look like glass anymore, at all. The button looks very flat if you can see, that the background isn&rsquo;t distorted by the &lsquo;glass&rsquo; in any kind.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>CoreImage</h2>

<p>The solution to this problem sounds quite easy at first: As soon as you simply blur the background just a little, the whole thing starts looking great again. This is where CoreImage comes in handy. CoreImage has a ton of useful filters, one of them is a gaussian blur filter. Using this filter is pretty easy. All you need to do is specify you input image and the blur radius you would like to use.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">blur</span> <span class="nl">setValue:</span><span class="err">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">blurRadius</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nl">forKey:</span><span class="s">@&quot;inputRadius&quot;</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">blur</span> <span class="nl">setValue:</span><span class="n">inputImage</span> <span class="nl">forKey:</span><span class="s">@&quot;inputImage&quot;</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">CIImage</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">outputImage</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">blur</span> <span class="n">outputImage</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Note that you are dealing with <code>CIImage</code>&rsquo;s instead of <code>UIImage</code>&rsquo;s. So <code>inputImage</code> has to be a <code>CIImage*</code>.</em></p>

<h2>What to blur?</h2>

<p>Now that we know how to blur, the question would be: What to blur? And here is the point where things are getting difficult. There are three methods on CALayer that sound promising:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>setBackgroundFilters:</code> <em>&ldquo;An array of Core Image filters to apply to the content immediately behind the layer&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><code>setFilters</code>: <em>&ldquo;An array of Core Image filters to apply to the contents of the layer and its sublayers&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><code>setCompositingFilter</code>: <em>&ldquo;A CoreImage filter used to composite the layer and the content behind it&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>


<p>All three methods are available on iOS, you can call them, the filters are set and they will be returned if you call the getter. But that&rsquo;s pretty much all these methods do, at least up to iOS6. Under <em>&ldquo;special considerations&rdquo;</em> Apple says <em>&ldquo;This property is not supported on layers in iOS&rdquo;</em>. Note that there was an error in the documentation on iOS 6.0, where it said <em>&ldquo;This property relies on the presence of Core Image and its filters. In iOS, Core Image is available in iOS 5 and later only&rdquo;</em>. They changed this in the iOS 6.1 documentation, so don&rsquo;t wonder if you see the second text, you selected the <em>old</em> version of the <code>CALayer</code> documentation.</p>

<p>So using one of these properties won&rsquo;t work on iOS. The only other approach I am aware of on iOS, is to render the underlaying layers into a context and blur it yourself. You can do this with <code>CALayer</code> again. The method you are looking for is <code>-[CALayer renderInContext:]</code></p>

<p>This method renders the receiver and it&rsquo;s sublayers to the context you specify. &lsquo;But I want to render the views!&rsquo; you might think. That&rsquo;s correct, but <code>UIView</code> is just the delegate of the underlying layer. Each <code>UIView</code> has a layer it is responsible for and the layer hierarchy is the same as the view hierarchy &ndash; unless you change something about this by yourself. The visible part of a <code>UIView</code> is the <code>CALayer</code>! If a view has five subviews, its layer has five sublayers and each of these sublayers belong to one of the subviews.</p>

<h2>Drawing</h2>

<p>To render the background of the button we want to blur, we simply walk up the view hierarchy until we find the first view that is opaque. If the view is opaque we can safely render this view and its subviews without worrying about transparent parts from underlaying views.</p>

<p>To achieve this, we create a new graphics context in the size of the button that should get the blurred background. We don&rsquo;t need to render the whole superview we just found, as we only need to blur the part that is behind our button. The rendered image is what we will use as our input image for the blur filter. Don&rsquo;t forget to hide the button during rendering, otherwise the button itself will be contained in the button&rsquo;s background.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After rendering the view into a <code>CGImage</code> we convert this to a <code>CIImage</code> and set it as the input image of our blur filter. If you put all this code into your button&rsquo;s <code>drawInRect:</code> method, you can then draw the output image into the current context for displaying. After that, you can call all the other drawing code, if any, you need for your button.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="n">CIImage</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">inputImage</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">CIImage</span> <span class="nl">imageWithCGImage:</span><span class="n">blurInputReference</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">CGImageRef</span> <span class="n">blurOutput</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">context</span> <span class="nl">createCGImage:</span><span class="n">outputImage</span> <span class="nl">fromRect:</span><span class="n">outputImage</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">extent</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">CGContextDrawImage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">outputImage</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">extent</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">blurOutput</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Not that we render the output image with the extent of the <code>CIImage</code> as the blur filter will return an image that is larger than your input image. The extent property of you output image has a negative origin so that rendering the image with this extent will place your image exactly above your input image, with a border.</em></p>

<h2>BCBlurView on GitHub</h2>

<p>I have set up a <a href="https://github.com/michaelochs/BCBlurView" title="BCBlurView on github">GitHub project</a> that adds a method to <code>UIView</code> that renders the view&rsquo;s background with a given blur radius into the current context. You can call this method on any UIView in it&rsquo;s <code>drawRect:</code> method to get a blurred background. The static library also contains two subclasses, one of UIView and one of UIButton. Those adopt this category and, aside from others, make the blur radius available as a property for easier use.</p>

<h2>Special considerations</h2>

<p>This approach only works with still backgrounds. If you have any kind of animation in the background, this will not work. If the background changes, you have to call <code>setNeedsDisplay</code> on the view that has the blurred background. Note that blurring takes time, it is not possible to e.g. put a <code>UIScrollView</code> in the back of the button and call <code>setNeedsDisplay</code> on every scroll position change of the scroll view.</p>
