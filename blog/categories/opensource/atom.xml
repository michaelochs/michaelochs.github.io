    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>A quick overview</h2>

<p>The first thing that might come to mind when reading the headline is: Why? There already are a couple of stores available for you to choose from. And of course, as long as these fit your needs, you definitely don&rsquo;t want to do the heavy lifting your self and implement your own store.</p>

<h3>In-Memory</h3>

<p>The In-Memory store <code>NSInMemoryStoreType</code> is a store that, as the name suggests, stays completely in memory. It is never written to disk. If you or the system completely quits you app, all your data is gone. You typically would use this as a cache or store other data that can easily be reproduced.</p>

<h3>Binary</h3>

<p>The binary store <code>NSBinaryStoreType</code> is a store that is written on disk in one binary file. It is loaded into memory at once and it is written to disk at once. There is no incremental loading at all. You typically want to use this kind of store only for very small data. The benefit is that accessing data from it is pretty fast, once the store has loaded all the data from the disk.</p>

<h3>SQLite</h3>

<p>The <code>NSSQLiteStoreType</code> is what will match most of the database-like approaches. It stores its content into an sqlite database and can incrementally pull data out of it or push data into it. It is still pretty fast but you don&rsquo;t have to load all the data into memory. If you execute a fetch and the object is not already in the context that is executing the fetch or any parent context, it will load this particular object from disk without touching all the other objects that are stored in the sqlite database as well.</p>

<h3>XML</h3>

<p>The XML store type <code>NSXMLStoreType</code> is not available on iOS. It uses an XML data structure to store its elements. It is completely loaded into memory, like the binary store type. The big difference here is, that you can open XML stores with any other tool that is capable of reading XML data.</p>

<h2>Your store</h2>

<p>The XML store shows why you maybe want or need to implement your own store: If you have a given data format and want to operate on this data but don&rsquo;t want to miss the convenience of CoreData you can either choose to convert the data and store it into one of the given store types or you can write your own store and directly operate on your data. The last approach is very useful if there are other applications that need to use the data or if there is somebody who is constantly managing the data by hand, e.g. in a csv file. Instead of always converting between an existing CoreData store and the csv file, you can create a store that is capable of reading and writing this csv file directly.</p>

<h3>NSPersistentStoreCoordinator</h3>

<p>When using CoreData, you don&rsquo;t use the NSPersistentStore your self. Instead, you talk to your NSManagedObjectContext which walks up the context context hierarchy &ndash; as long as there is one &ndash; and finally talks to the NSPersistentStoreCoordinator. The NSPersistentStoreCoordinator hands the objects to the NSPersistentStore. The coordinator however is capable of handling multiple stores and &ndash; as long as each entity type is only assigned to one store &ndash; automatically decides which object goes to which store. This behaviour makes room for a couple of other interesting use cases. One example: You are writing a twitter client and need to store a number of twitter timelines in your application. You save these posts in CoreData as it is really easy to set up a table view with CoreData and an NSFetchedResultsController. However, the credentials of the user accounts in your application should be stored in a secure way, so you put them in the KeyChain. You are always dealing with two data storing approaches. With your own custom store, you can create a User entity that holds the credentials for one user and then assign this entity to a store that writes all the informations into the keychain whereas all the other data is stored in an sqlite store type. If you choose this approach, CoreData handles this process completely transparent for the rest of your application. You create User objects and tweet objects in the same context, you save them and the User entity is automatically stored in the key chain.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A glossy looking button is a well known and widely used type of button that everybody knows if he or she hasn&rsquo;t been on the moon the last couple of years. Apple uses these buttons excessive. In OS X as well as on iOS. Those buttons look nice and they work very well when trying to achieve a polished, three dimensional look. However, they are always used with a background color that differs from the surrounding background or the surrounding background doesn&rsquo;t have much detail. This is because if you use this button on a background that has a lot of detail, like a photo, they don&rsquo;t look like glass anymore, at all. The button looks very flat if you can see, that the background isn&rsquo;t distorted by the &lsquo;glass&rsquo; in any kind.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>CoreImage</h2>

<p>The solution to this problem sounds quite easy at first: As soon as you simply blur the background just a little, the whole thing starts looking great again. This is where CoreImage comes in handy. CoreImage has a ton of useful filters, one of them is a gaussian blur filter. Using this filter is pretty easy. All you need to do is specify you input image and the blur radius you would like to use.</p>

<p><em>Note that you are dealing with <code>CIImage</code>&rsquo;s instead of <code>UIImage</code>&rsquo;s. So <code>inputImage</code> has to be a <code>CIImage*</code>.</em></p>

<h2>What to blur?</h2>

<p>Now that we know how to blur, the question would be: What to blur? And here is the point where things are getting difficult. There are three methods on CALayer that sound promising:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>setBackgroundFilters:</code> <em>&ldquo;An array of Core Image filters to apply to the content immediately behind the layer&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><code>setFilters</code>: <em>&ldquo;An array of Core Image filters to apply to the contents of the layer and its sublayers&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><code>setCompositingFilter</code>: <em>&ldquo;A CoreImage filter used to composite the layer and the content behind it&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>


<p>All three methods are available on iOS, you can call them, the filters are set and they will be returned if you call the getter. But that&rsquo;s pretty much all these methods do, at least up to iOS6. Under <em>&ldquo;special considerations&rdquo;</em> Apple says <em>&ldquo;This property is not supported on layers in iOS&rdquo;</em>. Note that there was an error in the documentation on iOS 6.0, where it said <em>&ldquo;This property relies on the presence of Core Image and its filters. In iOS, Core Image is available in iOS 5 and later only&rdquo;</em>. They changed this in the iOS 6.1 documentation, so don&rsquo;t wonder if you see the second text, you selected the <em>old</em> version of the <code>CALayer</code> documentation.</p>

<p>So using one of these properties won&rsquo;t work on iOS. The only other approach I am aware of on iOS, is to render the underlaying layers into a context and blur it yourself. You can do this with <code>CALayer</code> again. The method you are looking for is <code>-[CALayer renderInContext:]</code></p>

<p>This method renders the receiver and it&rsquo;s sublayers to the context you specify. &lsquo;But I want to render the views!&rsquo; you might think. That&rsquo;s correct, but <code>UIView</code> is just the delegate of the underlying layer. Each <code>UIView</code> has a layer it is responsible for and the layer hierarchy is the same as the view hierarchy &ndash; unless you change something about this by yourself. The visible part of a <code>UIView</code> is the <code>CALayer</code>! If a view has five subviews, its layer has five sublayers and each of these sublayers belong to one of the subviews.</p>

<h2>Drawing</h2>

<p>To render the background of the button we want to blur, we simply walk up the view hierarchy until we find the first view that is opaque. If the view is opaque we can safely render this view and its subviews without worrying about transparent parts from underlaying views.</p>

<p>To achieve this, we create a new graphics context in the size of the button that should get the blurred background. We don&rsquo;t need to render the whole superview we just found, as we only need to blur the part that is behind our button. The rendered image is what we will use as our input image for the blur filter. Don&rsquo;t forget to hide the button during rendering, otherwise the button itself will be contained in the button&rsquo;s background.</p>

<p>After rendering the view into a <code>CGImage</code> we convert this to a <code>CIImage</code> and set it as the input image of our blur filter. If you put all this code into your button&rsquo;s <code>drawInRect:</code> method, you can then draw the output image into the current context for displaying. After that, you can call all the other drawing code, if any, you need for your button.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p><em>Not that we render the output image with the extent of the <code>CIImage</code> as the blur filter will return an image that is larger than your input image. The extent property of you output image has a negative origin so that rendering the image with this extent will place your image exactly above your input image, with a border.</em></p>

<h2>BCBlurView on GitHub</h2>

<p>I have set up a <a href="https://github.com/michaelochs/BCBlurView" title="BCBlurView on github">GitHub project</a> that adds a method to <code>UIView</code> that renders the view&rsquo;s background with a given blur radius into the current context. You can call this method on any UIView in it&rsquo;s <code>drawRect:</code> method to get a blurred background. The static library also contains two subclasses, one of UIView and one of UIButton. Those adopt this category and, aside from others, make the blur radius available as a property for easier use.</p>

<h2>Special considerations</h2>

<p>This approach only works with still backgrounds. If you have any kind of animation in the background, this will not work. If the background changes, you have to call <code>setNeedsDisplay</code> on the view that has the blurred background. Note that blurring takes time, it is not possible to e.g. put a <code>UIScrollView</code> in the back of the button and call <code>setNeedsDisplay</code> on every scroll position change of the scroll view.</p>
