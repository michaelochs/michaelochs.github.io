iOS coding is a blog about developing iOS apps. The blog contains posts about my open source projects as well as my thoughts about various things related to iOS and Apple.

My name is Michael Ochs, I am a passionate iOS developer based in Cologne, Germany. During the week I am working as iOS Engineer, doing contract work for [PSPDFKit GmbH](http://pspdfkit.com). On the weekend I work on my own stuff. You will find my Open Source work on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelochs/). My biggest project is [ViewDeck](https://github.com/ViewDeck/ViewDeck). I am also open for contract work on smaller projects.

I am developing iOS apps since 2009 and really enjoy the iOS platform as a great opportunity to create innovative, intuitive and easy to use interfaces that can solve quite complex problems and make peopleâ€™s life easier.
