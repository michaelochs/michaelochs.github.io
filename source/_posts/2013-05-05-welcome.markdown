Welcome to ios-coding! My name is Michael Ochs, I am an iOS software engineer working in Cologne. This blog will deal with iOS development and things Apple does, from a developers perspective.Â I am writing about open source projects I use or participate in and about code samples I find useful during my work. I hope you will find useful ideas and tips on this blog and enjoy reading it. If you want to find out more about myself, check out the [about page](/about).
